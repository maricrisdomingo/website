<p><b>Kapurpurawan Rock Formation</b><br>
<b>Location: Burgos, Ilocos Norte</b><br>
<br>
"If you want to empress your friends, these rock formations are the best background in your photos!" 
<br>
<br>
Standing beautifully in the coast of the town of Burgos, fronting the roaring waves of Bangui Bay, Kapurpurawan <br> 
Rock Formation was formed thousands (or even millions) of years ago by accumulation of particles deposited to<br>  the 
shore by the forces of sea waves and wind, with the aid of gravity and time. It is a very long process known 
in<br>  science as sedimentation.<br><br>  The name of this formation is derived from it's characteristically white color.
In ilocano, the word puraw means white.<br>  The rock also looks like a large dragon 
watching over the entire coast. Once you reach it, you'll be rewarded with the<br> natural beauty of the erosion created
 by the years and years of crashing ocean waves. <br>

<p><b>The Sinking Bell Tower</b><br>
<b>Location: Laoag City</b><br>

"One of the main landmarks of Laoag and within walking distance 
of St Williams Cathedral - so both sites can be conveniently visited at the same time."<br>
<br>
If Italy has its leaning tower of Pisa, Laoag City has its own local version.
This edifice is one of the tallest bell towers in the<br> country and its located
in the heart of the city. As of today, it stands at 45m tall.
<br>
<br>
The bell tower is one of the landmarks of Spanish colony in the Philippines. The tower has earned its
 sinking reputation  because it is so heavy and it was built on sandy foundations that it has been 
 consistently sinking into the ground. <br>One story said that when the bell tower was newly built, a person 
 on horseback could enter the tower, but today a person with normal<br> height has to bend first just to pass the entrance. 
 Quite interesting :) But despite of this, the bell tower still continues its purpose of ringing the bell to call the 
 Catholic brethren to mass.

<p><b>La Paz Sand Dunes</b><br>
<b>Location: Laoag City, Ilocos Norte</b><br>
<br>
"If you're not afraid of heights and of not being in control, this is for you. You'll ride a 4x4 truck that will take you through the sand dunes."
<br>
<br>
The sand dunes of Ilocos were created by the interaction of the wind, sea, and river that together cause erosion and deposition. The size of 
the dunes varies depending on a number of factors, including the currents, weather conditions, <br>nature of winds, amount 
of sediment, and type of vegetation in the area. <br><br>

This sand dunes are accessible by tricycle or jeepney. They're only 15 minutes away from the city proper. 
Due to its desert environment, it is a popular location for shooting films for both local and international
 film makers alike. Notable local films <br>include HIMALA and PANDAY, and the international
 films are MAD MAX and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.

 hotel is located was sprawling. <br>
 <br>The decor is a step up from other hotels: it exuded Old World ambiance, a far cry from the cookie cutter 
 interiors of hotel chains. It had quality rugs on the floor and hardwood furniture.
